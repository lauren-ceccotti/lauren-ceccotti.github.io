    <p>
        I started to be interested in combining digital technologies with an artistic
        process when I was studying in École des beaux-arts.
        I made some personal projects while I started creating online portfolios for artists
        or art galleries websites as a freelancer which made me somebody autonomous and
        with a high sense of responsibilities .
        <br>These collaborations made me want to improve my skills, so I completed a developer
        professional training and got my IT degree. Then I was hired in companies providing BtoB tools
        for luxury groups, education, administration… and also institutional or BtoC websites.
        <br>I made many teammates, and even if I still take some freelance missions,
        I prefer being a part of a team that works on long term projects.
        <br>
        <br>Back from an eight months trip around the world,
        I’m looking for a team with whom I wish to take up inspiring challenges and build ambitious projects.
