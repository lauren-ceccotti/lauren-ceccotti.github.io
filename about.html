        Things start while i’m studying in the School of Fine Arts that allows me to use
        digital technologies on artistic processes. After completing my master’s degree,
        I quickly start producing online portfolios for artists or art galleries websites.

        <br>Having these professional collaborations lead me to improve
        my skills in pursuing a vocational training
        <br>
        <br>Obtaining my IT degree brings me to get multiples company jobs, whether for
        luxury groups, education, web applications or mobile devices.

        These experiences allow me to make many team-mates. This part of the experience becomes very important to me given the emulation it provides.

        <br>That doesn't stop me to continue
        <a href="https://www.malt.fr/profile/laurenceccotti" target="_blank">freelancer missions</a>
        until today.
        <br>
        <br>Back from an eight months trip around the world, I’m looking for a team
        with whom I wish to take up inspiring challenges and build ambitious projects.
