        I quickly start producing online portfolios for artists or art galleries websites.

        <br>
        <br>Obtaining my IT degree takes me to increase multiples company jobs, whether for luxury groups, education, web applications or mobile devices.
        These experiences makes me become a "team addict" given the emulation this kind of environment provides.
